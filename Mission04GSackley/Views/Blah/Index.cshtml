    The picture above is me snorkeling in Hawaii! I really enjoy snorkeling and seeing all things under water. In terms of IS 413, I want to learn lots from this class.
    I want to continue to develop my developing skills and learn as much as I can about ASP.NET. I also want to learn how to be cool like Pro Hilton. Him saying
    "Spencer out" at the end of all his videos is an inspiration.
