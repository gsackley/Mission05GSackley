    <p>The picture above is me snorkeling in Hawaii! I really enjoy snorkeling and seeing all things under water. In terms of IS 413, I want to learn lots from this class. 
    I want to continue to develop my developing skills and learn as much as I can about ASP.NET. I also want to learn how to be cool like Pro Hilton. Him saying 
    "Spencer out" at the end of all his videos is an inspiration.</p>
